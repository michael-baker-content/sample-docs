# Complete Guide to Using Docusaurus

This comprehensive guide covers everything you need to know about using Docusaurus effectively for your documentation projects.

## Getting Started

### Development Server

To start the development server and preview your site locally:

```bash
npm run start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Building for Production

To generate static content for production deployment:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

## Creating Content

### Documentation Pages

Documentation pages are written in Markdown and stored in the `docs/` folder. Each file automatically becomes a page on your site.

#### File Structure

```
docs/
├── intro.md
├── using-docusaurus.md
└── advanced/
    └── configuration.md
```

#### Front Matter

Each documentation page should include front matter at the top:

```markdown
---
sidebar_position: 1
title: My Page Title
---

# Page Content
```

Common front matter options:

- `sidebar_position`: Controls the order in the sidebar
- `title`: Sets the page title (overrides the H1 heading)
- `slug`: Customizes the URL path

### Blog Posts

Create blog posts in the `blog/` directory:

```markdown
---
slug: welcome-post
title: Welcome
authors: [author-name]
tags: [docusaurus, hello]
---

Blog post content here...
```

### Pages

Create standalone pages in `src/pages/` using React components or Markdown files.

## Navigation and Sidebars

### Sidebar Configuration

Edit `sidebars.js` to customize your documentation navigation:

```javascript
const sidebars = {
  tutorialSidebar: [
    "intro",
    {
      type: "category",
      label: "Guides",
      items: ["guide1", "guide2"],
    },
  ],
};
```

### Autogenerated Sidebars

Use the autogenerated option to automatically create sidebars from your folder structure:

```javascript
tutorialSidebar: [{ type: "autogenerated", dirName: "." }];
```

## Customization

### Configuration

Main site configuration is in `docusaurus.config.js`:

- Site metadata (title, tagline, URL)
- Theme configuration
- Plugin settings
- Navigation bar items

### Styling

Customize the appearance using:

- `src/css/custom.css` for global styles
- CSS modules for component-specific styles
- Custom React components in `src/components/`

### Themes

Docusaurus comes with a default theme, but you can:

- Customize the existing theme
- Use community themes
- Create your own theme

## Deployment

### Static Hosting

After building (`npm run build`), deploy the `build/` folder to:

- GitHub Pages
- Netlify
- Vercel
- Any static hosting service

### GitHub Pages

For GitHub Pages deployment:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This command builds the website and pushes to the `gh-pages` branch.

## Advanced Features

### Search

Add search functionality using:

- Algolia DocSearch
- Local search plugins

### Internationalization (i18n)

Support multiple languages by:

1. Configuring locales in `docusaurus.config.js`
2. Creating translation files
3. Organizing content by locale

### Plugins

Extend functionality with plugins for:

- Analytics
- SEO optimization
- Content processing
- Custom features

## Best Practices

1. **Organize Content**: Use clear folder structures and meaningful file names
2. **Write Good Metadata**: Include descriptive titles and front matter
3. **Link Between Pages**: Use relative links to connect related content
4. **Test Builds**: Regularly test production builds before deployment
5. **Keep It Simple**: Start with basic features and add complexity as needed

## Useful Commands

| Command           | Description                    |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `npm run start`   | Start development server       |
| `npm run build`   | Build for production           |
| `npm run serve`   | Serve production build locally |
| `npm run clear`   | Clear Docusaurus cache         |
