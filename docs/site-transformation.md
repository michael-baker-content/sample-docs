# Site Transformation Journey

This page documents the comprehensive transformation this Docusaurus site underwent, from initial setup issues to becoming a beautifully designed documentation website with a printed book aesthetic.

## Overview of Changes

During our development session, this site evolved from a basic Docusaurus template with technical issues into a polished, book-inspired documentation platform. Here's the complete journey:

---

## ðŸ”§ Technical Fixes & Setup

### 1. Development Server Configuration

**Problem**: The dev server was configured to run `npm run dev` but Docusaurus uses `npm run start`.

**Solution Applied**:

```bash
# Fixed dev server command
npm run start  # Instead of npm run dev
```

**Recommended Prompt**:

> "The app seems to be in a broken state, please fix and debug. The dev server command seems to be crashing with 'Missing script: dev' error."

### 2. React CreateRoot Warning Fix

**Problem**: React 18 createRoot() warning during hot reloads in development.

**Solution Applied**:

- Updated Docusaurus from version 3.1.1 to 3.8.1
- Fixed broken links in footer configuration

**Recommended Prompt**:

> "Debug and fix these errors: Warning: You are calling ReactDOMClient.createRoot() on a container that has already been passed to createRoot() before."

### 3. Broken Links Resolution

**Problem**: Footer links pointing to non-existent pages (`/docs/intro`, `/blog`).

**Solution Applied**:

- Updated footer links to point to existing pages
- Removed references to disabled blog functionality

## ðŸ“„ Content Restructuring

### 4. Homepage Transformation

**Original**: Basic intro page with resume content
**New**: Compelling landing page with hero section and value proposition

**Changes Made**:

- Removed resume content from intro.md
- Created engaging homepage with Docusaurus benefits
- Added hero image and call-to-action buttons
- Implemented professional value proposition section

**Recommended Prompt**:

> "Change the content of the homepage to indicate that this website is a Docusaurus documentation website and provide a quick teaser for why someone might want to use Docusaurus along with an appropriate hero image."

### 5. Documentation Structure

**Added**:

- Comprehensive Docusaurus usage guide
- Detailed installation and configuration instructions
- Best practices and advanced features documentation

**Recommended Prompt**:

> "Add a new section to this site that documents how to use Docusaurus."
